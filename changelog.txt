    - Now using `svcorelib` instead of `svjsl`

[closed-beta-0.7]

    - removed webhook for now
    - removed tons of options in "settings.cfg"
    - added ESLint support
    - fixed wrapping script

[closed-beta-0.6]

    - Improved wrapper and main scripts to support the VS Code debugger
    - Added legend at the top of this document
    - Removed boot loop detection so CF-DUC doesn't die as easily in an outage (like the one that happened on July 3rd 2019)

[closed-beta-0.4] - Complete rewrite: more stability, more efficient code
    - asynchronous approach
        - doesn't take as long to start up
        - is way more reliable
        - ensures that things are done in the correct order
    - better config reader (from my closed beta project JServ)
    - more reliable public IP getter

        - backup IP getter for when one of them is down or returns an error

	- minor fixes (duplicate console messages, ...)
    - temporary error catcher
    - removed package "workspace-hash" for now

[alpha-0.3] - (abandoned version)
    - added command line interface UI
    - minor things fixed or changed here and there (what I mean by that is I didn't keep track like a true developer)

[alpha-0.2] - Full error handler, better sorted source code, a bit of quality assurance
    - removed yesno library and added selfmade shutdown prompt
    - replaced public-ip library with get-my-ip and then to externalip
    - added error handler with full descriptions
    - updated dependencies
    - added package "node-wrap" to wrap the DUC and restart it if it crashes
    - added package "workspace-hash" to create a checksum to verify the integrity of the DUC

[alpha-0.1] - Basic functionality but almost no error catching and QA
